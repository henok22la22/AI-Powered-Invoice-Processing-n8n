# AI-Powered-Invoice-Processing-n8n
This intelligent document workflow automates the extraction of structured data (like invoice numbers, dates, amounts, and vendor names) from uploaded PDF invoices—whether uploaded one at a time or in bulk—and stores the extracted data in a searchable database. It uses a combination of file handling, text extraction, AI-powered information processing, and database storage.

# Step-by-Step Workflow Description
1. Trigger – File Upload Detection
The process begins when a user uploads one or more invoice files. These can be single documents or multiple files uploaded at once. The system automatically detects the upload and starts the workflow.
Think of this as the "doorbell"—as soon as a new file is uploaded, the system wakes up and gets to work.

2. Get File – Retrieving the Document
Once triggered, the system fetches the uploaded file. This step ensures the document is ready for processing. The file’s basic metadata (like file name and upload time) is also passed along.
This is like opening the envelope and pulling out the invoice so it can be read.

3. Extract Text – Reading the Content
The system now reads the content of the invoice. If it’s a digital PDF, the text is extracted directly. If it’s scanned or a picture-based file, optical character recognition (OCR) is used to convert images into readable text.
This is the equivalent of someone reading the entire document, word by word, and converting it into plain text.

4. Information Extractor – Understanding the Details
Now the smart part happens. The system analyzes the raw text to find and extract important information like:
•	Invoice number
•	Date
•	Vendor name
•	Total amount
This step uses artificial intelligence (AI) or pattern-matching logic to identify and isolate these key pieces of information.
Imagine an intelligent assistant who reads the invoice and fills out a form with all the important details.

5. Save to Database – Storing the Results
Finally, the extracted information is saved into a database. This creates a permanent, searchable record of each invoice, making it easy to track spending, generate reports, or search for specific transactions later on.
It’s like filing the invoice into a digital cabinet where you can easily look it up whenever needed.
